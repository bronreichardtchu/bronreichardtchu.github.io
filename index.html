								<p>
									I use some of the largest optical telescopes on Earth to study how gas moves through galaxies, helping us understand how these galaxies have formed and evolved through cosmic time.  The key question I am trying to answer is: how do stars influence the gas around them, and what does that mean for the formation of future stars?  Does this change over cosmic time?
									<br>
									<br>
									To answer this question, I use 3D data from a type of instrument called an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFU) to trace gas being blown out of galaxies and connect it back to the underlying star formation.  I also use high-resolution images to pick out individual massive stars and star clusters, studying their impact on the surrounding gas. While my main focus is on optical observations, I have an interest in combining multi-wavelength observations to get a clearer picture of all phases of gas in galaxies.  Recently, I applied my knowledge of astronomy to build a system for processing images to help track and monitor satellites.
								</p>
								<p>
									Before moving to Durham for my postdoc, I did my PhD at the Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing (CAS) at Swinburne University of Technology working with <a href="https://www.deannefisher.com/">Deanne Fisher</a> on <a href="#stellarfeedback">galaxy-scale outflows driven by star formation</a>.  During my Masters of Research in Astronomy at Macquarie University, I worked with <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/richard-mcdermid">Richard McDermid</a> on <a href="#MResProject">variations of the initial mass function</a> in early type galaxies.  I also worked on a couple of <a href="#undergradprojects">projects as an undergraduate</a> with <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/lee-spitler">Lee Spitler</a>.

								<h3>Stellar Feedback</h3>
								<p>
									Stellar feedback occurs when massive stars release energy in the form of winds, radiation and supernovae explosions, which stir up the surrounding gas and slow down further star formation.  This process helps regulate how stars are born. In fact, simulations of galaxies can't accurately replicate key galaxy features - like galaxy mass, size, and star formation rates - unless they include stellar feedback.  However, understanding the physics behind stellar feedback is challenging because it happens on a huge range of scales - from the area around individual stars to massive winds that affect entire galaxies.
								<br>
								<br>
									To study stellar feedback, I use data from the <a href="https://www.deannefisher.com/duvet">DUVET</a> sample, which looks at starbursting disk galaxies.  These are galaxies that are undergoing intense star formation.  The DUVET sample uses observations taken with the IFU instrument KCWI on the Keck Telescope in Hawaii to track galaxy winds driven by star formation. These winds, caused by the radiation from young massive stars and supernova explosions, push gas and dust out of the galaxy, creating turbulence and regulating star formation. If the wind is powerful enough, it can escape the galaxy altogether and contribute gas to the area around the galaxy, known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM).
									Understanding these processes is crucial, especially in starbursting environments, since these are the type of environments where the majority of stars in the universe were created.  However, the physical parameters regulating outflows and stellar feedback generally are not yet fully understood.

									<h3>Outflows cover the whole disk in a starbursting galaxy</h3>
									I studied a face-on starbursting disk galaxy in our local Universe (IRAS 08339+6517) using observations taken with KCWI/Keck for the DUVET sample.  Using KCWI means that we could get spatially resolved observations (about 500pc) and search for outflows across the entire face of the galaxy.  To identify outflows I developed an automated fitting routine to systematically determine whether a double Gaussian fit was necessary using the Bayesian Information Criterion.  Using this fitting routine (which I nicknamed <a href='https://github.com/bronreichardtchu/koffee'>Koffee</a>), I found evidence for outflows in all spaxels within the half-light radius, and in 70% of spaxels within a radius containing 90% of the galaxy light.
								 <br>
								 <br>
									The relationship between the star formation rate surface density and the outflow velocity has historically been used to observationally discriminate between the subgrid models used to describe star formation driven outflows in simulations (e.g. Chen et al. 2010, Murray et al. 2011, Newman et al. 2012b).  Two popular models in the literature are "energy-driven" and "momentum-driven" feedback models.  Energy-driven models assume the outflowing gas and turbulence within the ISM are driven by mechanical energy from supernovae.  The outflow velocity depends shallowly on the star formation activity within the galaxy (Chen et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2020).  Momentum-driven feedback models drive outflows and turbulence through radiative pressure from young massive stars.  These models have a steeper dependence of the outflow velocity on star formation activity (Murray et al. 2011).  I found that for our galaxy (IRAS 08339+6517), the correlation between SFR surface density and outflow velocity had a shallow slope which matched the slopes we expect from energy-driven wind models.  This is an important step towards fully characterising the dependence of star formation-driven feedback on the underlying stellar population.

									<h3>MRes Thesis: Variations in the IMF</h3>
									The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the original distribution of stellar masses in a stellar population.  The IMF is critical in our understanding of galaxy evolution over cosmic time. My thesis presented preliminary results from the Fornax3D survey using the MUSE integral field spectrograph. I compared two techniques for finding the IMF in the lenticular galaxy FCC167: full spectral fitting, and a more constrained approach focusing on a few key features. While the two methods agree reasonably well on radial variations for the age and abundance parameters, the derived IMF shape and its variation within the galaxy differ.  You can find my Masters Thesis <a href="https://figshare.mq.edu.au/articles/thesis/Constraining_variations_in_the_stellar_initial_mass_function_with_the_Fornax3D_Survey/19444598">here</a>.

								<h3>Undergraduate Projects</h3>
									As an undergraduate I worked on two separate projects with Dr. Lee Spitler.  The first project involved cataloguing supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies with a redshift greater than 3.0 using multi-wavelength catalogues. 
									<br>
									<br> 
									For the second project, I worked on the Huntsman Telephoto Eye (now the Huntsman Telescope) developing the initial pipeline to reduce data, combining exposures with different exposure times into a single image.  During the project, I travelled to Siding Springs for an initial test observation run using the first telephoto lens acquired for the array.
